  The puzzle consists of a series of sentences that don’t seem to make sense. The content of these sentences turn out to be related to The Simpsons and the title seems to be referencing the meme “Steamed Hams.” Each sentence is, in fact, a Printer’s Devilry clue. A word can be inserted into each sentence (and the punctuation and spaces are rearranged as needed) to fix it. The added word is a unique word from the transcript of “Steamed Hams” with an extra letter inserted. The enumeration of the correct word is given with each clue. Rearranging the extra letters by the order in which the words appear in the transcript yields the phrase: SUBMIT <span class="solved-title-answer">LAWN SHRUB</span>, a reference to the popular Homer Simpson gif.</p>
